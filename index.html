            <h3>Neoris de México</h3>
            <p>
              Software Engineer [August 2022 → December 2023]
              <br /><br />
              I collaborate at Neoris company as a software engineer. I had the opportunity to work on different projects with different teams developing and extending functionalities.
              <br />
              I work in several REST and gRPC APIs, which ran in Azure cloud as microservices. I built a self-hosting (self-signed certificate) REST API, that it ran as a Windows Service to manage and transfer information from their principal system (POS) to different microservices.
              <br />
              Also, I implemented a functionality with Data Factor service, to propagate automatically records among every domain. I used SQL Databases as principal repositories to persist the main information of every domain.
              I worked with Azure Blob Storage to save temporal/raw data which was finally processed for Azure Workers with the purpose to feed different databases (domains). And finally, I worked with a Service Bus to receive and queue requests from POS (client), to be launched every request invoking an Azure Function (Handler of multiple process communicated using gRPC), to process the data and save the result resources in the different cloud repositories.
              <br />
              Furthermore, in this project I had an express opportunity to have a technical support role to provide maintenance to our solution, providing solutions to every issue occurred in production environment.
              <br />
              My last participation concluded with a trainer role, to collaborate and communicate to Client’s L3 Team all the technical aspects and issues that we had throughout the development and deployment.
              <br />
              Finally, these projects were the most challenging that I've had in my career, because I had the opportunity to collaborate with many technologies on cloud and with a lot of experienced people. And I need to mention that this migration represented the most important Hito to our customer’s IT Area in the last years, because this solutions migrate all his modules (monolithic system) to cloud services (microservices) in Azure allowing to integrate with new services.

            <p>
              Software Engineer [May 2017 → August 2022]
              <br /><br />
              I participated principally in a Point of Sale of our client, developing different functionalities, working principally with desktop application as Windows Services (REST API’s) and WPF(M-V-VM) using Net Framework and PRISM. Also, I worked on extending functionalities in Windows Services (called satellites of POS).
              <br />
              In a little period in my career in this company I worked as a Technical Support (L3), providing support for issues and maintenance to old functionalities. I had this role in addition to that of software developer.
              <br />
              Finally, in the final part of my participation in this project, I gained more experience, first designing, and then, building software solutions when I was promoted with Application Design Manager (EDA) role. In this period, I had two roles at the same time, a technical designer and software developer.

              <br /><br />
              I participated in this company working with web and desktop projects, based principally on Classic ASP, MySQL, SQL Server and Windows Forms (Net Framework).
              <br />
              The first project in which I participated was a management web application, to handle and manage the different issues what the clients reported in our support line. This provides an easy way to manage this kind of reports and provided a useful tool to manage these cases in the support area.
              <br />
              My second participation was developing an accounting software, it allowed control the accounting movements, calculate the different taxes that exists in Mexico. Also,

              <br />
              My last participation we developing different small application called Addendas, that allowed our clients to feed every invoice with extra purchase information that is required by transmitter and receptor for every invoice. This allowed our company to increase the quantity of products/solutions to offer our customers. I develop at least 15 Addendas.

            I like helping people who don't have the beauty opportunity to have a close contact 
            with technology, because I consider some people, unfornately, never will know how this 
            environment can help them to improve their life quality.
